//Write a function that given a singly linked list will check to see if the linked list is cycled
//Normaly a linked list is expected to terminate in a .next = null fashion, a linked list can have a cycle if a node points to a previous node in the list
//The function should operate in linear time and constant space and do not mutate the nodes in any way
